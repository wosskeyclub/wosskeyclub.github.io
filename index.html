			<h1>Welcome back!</h1>
			<p>Welcome back for the 2017/2018 school year! Right now, we're in the process of planning for our next two known fundraisers. The first meeting was on Monday September 18th in room A118 (future meetings will be in room A128). Anyone is welcome, even if you didn't sign up during club fair or come to the first meeting.</p>
			
			<h2>What's new</h2>
			<p>During the end of last year, we have discussed ways to make key club better than it already was. To start off, this website is a new addition and is coded from scratch. It has all the up-to-date information about key club and the events, and it is also home to the Meme of the Week.</p>
			<p>Another addition is our Instagram account for those who don't want to keep checking back on this website. You can add us <a href="https://www.instagram.com/wosskeyclub/?hl=en">@wosskeyclub</a>. </p>
			<p>And finally, most of our administration is now online so we can get things quickly instead of forming ultra long lines for attendance and signing up for events.</p>
